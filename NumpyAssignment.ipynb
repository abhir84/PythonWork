    "#1. What is a Python library? Why do we use Python libraries?\n",
    "\n",
    "(a)Python library is simply a collection of codes or modules of codes that we can use in a program for specific operations. We use libraries so that we don’t need to write the code again in our program that is already available. But how it works. Actually, in the MS Windows environment, the library files have a DLL extension (Dynamic Load Libraries). When we link a library with our program and run that program, the linker automatically searches for that library. It extracts the functionalities of that library and interprets the program accordingly. That’s how we use the methods of a library in our program. \n",
    "\n",
    "(b)The Python Standard Library contains the exact syntax, semantics, and tokens of Python. It contains built-in modules that provide access to basic system functionality like I/O and some other core modules. Most of the Python Libraries are written in the C programming language. The Python standard library consists of more than 200 core modules. All these work together to make Python a high-level programming language. Python Standard Library plays a very important role. Without it, the programmers can’t have access to the functionalities of Python. But other than this, there are several other libraries in Python that make a programmer’s life easier.\n",
    "\n",
    "(c)\n",
    "Use of Libraries in Python Program\n",
    "As we write large-size programs in Python, we want to maintain the code’s modularity. For the easy maintenance of the code, we split the code into different parts and we can use that code later ever we need it. In Python, modules play that part. Instead of using the same code in different programs and making the code complex, we define mostly used functions in modules and we can just simply import them in a program wherever there is a requirement. We don’t need to write that code but still, we can use its functionality by importing its module. Multiple interrelated modules are stored in a library. And whenever we need to use a module, we import it from its library. In Python, it’s a very simple job to do due to its easy syntax. We just need to use import."

    "#14What does the np.reshape function do, and how is it used?\n",
    "\n",
    "The numpy.reshape() function allows us to reshape an array in Python. Reshaping basically means, changing the shape of an array. And the shape of an array is determined by the number of elements in each dimension.\n",
    "\n",
    "Reshaping allows us to add or remove dimensions in an array. We can also change the number of elements in each dimension.\n",
    "\n",
    "Syntax and parameters\n",
    "Here is the syntax of the function:\n",
    "\n",
    "numpy.reshape(array, shape, order = 'C')\n",
    "array: Input array.\n",
    "shape: Integers or tuples of integers.\n",
    "order: C-contiguous, F-contiguous, A-contiguous; this is an optional parameter.‘C’ order means that operating row-rise on the array will be slightly quicker. ‘F’ order means that column-wise operations will be faster. ‘A’ means to read / write the elements in Fortran-like index order.\n",
    "Return value: An array which is reshaped without any change to its data.\n",

    "#15.What is broadcasting in Numpy?\n",
    "The term broadcasting describes how NumPy treats arrays with different shapes during arithmetic operations. Subject to certain constraints, the smaller array is “broadcast” across the larger array so that they have compatible shapes. Broadcasting provides a means of vectorizing array operations so that looping occurs in C instead of Python. It does this without making needless copies of data and usually leads to efficient algorithm implementations. There are, however, cases where broadcasting is a bad idea because it leads to inefficient use of memory that slows computation.\n",
    "\n",
    "NumPy operations are usually done on pairs of arrays on an element-by-element basis. In the simplest case, the two arrays must have exactly the same shape, as in the following example:\n",
    "\n",
    "a = np.array([1.0, 2.0, 3.0])\n",
    "b = np.array([2.0, 2.0, 2.0])\n",
    "a * b\n",
    "array([2.,  4.,  6.])\n",
    "NumPy’s broadcasting rule relaxes this constraint when the arrays’ shapes meet certain constraints.The simplest broadcasting example occurs when an array and a scalar value are combined in an operation:\n",
    "\n",
    "a = np.array([1.0, 2.0, 3.0])\n",
    "b = 2.0\n",
    "a * b\n",
    "array([2.,  4.,  6.])\n",
    "The result is equivalent to the previous example where b was an array. We can think of the scalar b being stretched during the arithmetic operation into an array with the same shape as a.\n"
