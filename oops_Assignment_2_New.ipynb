Because call resolution for overloaded methods occurs at build time, it is known called compile time and static polymorphism. Parameters determine whether the overloaded version of the method is invoked. Dynamic polymorphism, on the other hand, refers to runtime polymorphism. Because method call resolution does not occur at build time; rather, it occurs at runtime when actual objects are formed. It is accomplished by method overriding. At runtime, every type of object determines which override method is called.\n",

Because this procedure occurs during build time, it is called Compile-Time Polymorphism. Build-time polymorphism occurs when an object is coupled, including its functionality at compile time. By inspecting the method signatures, Java determines the method to invoke at compile time. As a result, this is known as compile-time polymorphism, static polymorphism, or early binding. Method overloading is used to achieve compile-time polymorphism. Method Overloading states that you can have many functions that share the same name in the same class, each with a distinct prototype. Function overloading is a method of achieving polymorphism, although it depends on technology and the type of polymorphism used. In Java, function overloading is accomplished at the compile time.\n",

The Java virtual machine selects the method to invoke during runtime, not at compile time. It’s also known as dynamic and late binding. Method overriding indicates that the child class utilises the same function as the parent class. It indicates that method overriding occurs when a child class offers a custom implementation of a method offered by another of its parent classes."

The variable remains in memory until all references to it go out of scope. At that time, the CLR marks it as eligible for garbage collection.

    "What is Polymorphism?\n",
    "The literal meaning of polymorphism is the condition of occurrence in different forms.\n",
    "\n",
    "Polymorphism is a very important concept in programming. It refers to the use of a single type entity (method, operator or object) to represent different types in different scenarios.\n",
    "\n",
    "(b)Polymorphism is the ability to have objects of different types understanding the same message, so you can use those objects the same way without worrying about their concrete type.\n",
    "\n",
    "(c)Another way to use polymorphism in Python is by combining abstract methods and inheritance. This means that you can define an abstract method in a base class and then override it with different implementations in subclasses. This way, you can create a common interface for subclasses that share some functionality but differ in some details. For example, if you have a base class called DataProcessor that has an abstract method called process, you can override this method in subclasses like CSVProcessor, JSONProcessor, and XMLProcessor and provide different ways of processing data files. Here is an example of how to do this:\n",
